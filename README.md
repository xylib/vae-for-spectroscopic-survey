# Investigation of stellar magnetic activity using VAE
The demo code of the VAE model for the investigation of the stellar magnetic activity based on low-resolution spectroscopic surveys.

This VAE model is used for generating inactive template spectra with two different resolutions, which can be used for the spectral subtraction and the analysis on the stellar magnetic activity. We also provide 1000 spectra for the demo. One can run the demo jupyter notebook with the following requirements.

Requirements:

h5py

tqdm

numpy

joblib

pytorch

matplotlib

scikit-learn
